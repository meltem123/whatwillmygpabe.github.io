## Welcome to Our Project

This website inform about our project which is called 'What will my GPA be?'

Our project will be used by the students of the universities to help their students learn their understandings, their teachings, and their productivity in their institutions. Early intervention in academic life helps students to change their course of education and graduate early with better grades. Universities all over the world struggle with retention of students. Many tools and techniques are developed to help students, faculty, and administrators to cope with advising students efficiently. In this project “big data” analytics will be used to help universities to understand their students, teaching efficiency in their institutions by learning from data. We will develop a software tool which is analyzing and visualizing data from past student enrollments in classes and their grades.
